* Using Stack to manage alternative versions of GHC
Recently I have been working with some extensions of GHC, that are
planned to land (presumably) in version 8.2, therefore there was a
need of figuring out how to handle working with various versions of
GHC, that were compiled from source.

Stack already offers that functionality, so I was playing around
making it work.

** Checking out a custom version of GHC
So, the particular branch I am working is wip/ttypeable maintained by
Ben Gamari, so I made a shallow clone of that particular branch from
his repository

*** Github plumbing
So there is some necessary plumbing that needs to be done before
checking out ben's fork.

#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/bgamari/ghc.git -b wip/ttypeable ghc-ttypeable
#+END_SRC
